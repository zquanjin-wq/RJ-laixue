# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Pro-mode slide element clipboard** — Implement copy, cut, and paste for selected slide elements, including `Ctrl/Cmd+C`, `Ctrl/Cmd+X`, and `Ctrl/Cmd+V`. The editor-local clipboard avoids browser permission constraints while preserving structured slide data. Pasted elements receive new IDs, retain copied group relationships under a new group ID, and offset by 20px per paste. Pro-mode clipboard actions now use the canonical slide-edit operation path, so they participate in undo/redo and auto-save through the stage store's Dexie persistence. This replaces the upstream OpenMAIC placeholder handlers that reported `Not implemented`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-02

### Features

- **MAIC Editor (v0) — slide editing surface** — A new **Pro Mode** toggle turns any generated slide into an editable canvas: select and edit text, insert text boxes and images, navigate and reorder slides from a thumbnail rail, with history-aware undo/redo. This is the first surface of the broader MAIC Editor framework (gated behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIC_EDITOR_ENABLED`) [#615](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/615)
- **Editable outline before generation** — The streaming course outline now morphs into an inline editor: review, edit, reorder, and add or delete scenes and bullet points, then confirm to generate the full course — so you catch structure problems before spending a full generation [#558](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/558)
- **Offline-ready classroom export** — Exported teaching resource packs and classroom ZIPs now inline external assets so interactive pages open fully offline, even when copied to another machine [#613](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/613)
- Add Claude Opus 4.8 and MiniMax M3 to the default model registry [#635](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/635)

### Bug Fixes

- **Server-configured providers are now admin-managed** — providers set via server environment can no longer be overridden by client settings, preventing base-URL/key tampering on shared deployments [#624](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/624); fixes server API-key fallback when the client echoes the provider base URL [#533](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/533) (by @LooThao); auto-selects the server LLM model [#577](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/577) (by @xuruiray); and enforces a "usable provider ⇒ concrete model" invariant [#581](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/581)
- Keep interactive scenes alive across remounts with an iframe keep-alive pool, so interactive content no longer reloads when navigating [#629](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/629)
- Restore the orchestration director's ability to answer the user's question and stop runaway turns (removed `maxTurns`) [#599](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/599); restore agent attribution in the director summary [#554](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/554) (by @ashutoshrana)
- Skip shapes with malformed SVG paths instead of aborting the whole PPTX export [#505](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/505); prevent memory leaks and silent export failures [#552](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/552) (by @arnow117)
- Add defensive checks in ChartElement to prevent crashes on malformed chart data [#588](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/588) (by @tongshu2023)
- Let whiteboard code elements capture internal scroll/drag instead of the canvas [#544](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/544) (by @cosarah)
- Preserve discussion triggers when importing classroom ZIPs [#557](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/557) (by @cosarah)

- Fix the commercial licensing contact email [#604](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/604) (by @DHQ1204)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-26

### Features

- **[VoxCPM2](https://github.com/OpenBMB/VoxCPM) TTS provider with voice cloning** — OpenMAIC adapts to user-managed VoxCPM backends (vLLM-Omni, Nano-VLLM, official Python API). Clone any voice from a reference audio clip you upload or record in the browser, or let Auto Voice generate a fitting voice from each agent's persona at synthesis time. Voice profiles are stored locally to keep the serverless setup model. The Agent Bar exposes a searchable, previewable voice picker that draws from the global VoxCPM voice pool [#496](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/496)
- **Per-model thinking configuration** — First-class metadata for each model's reasoning capability (effort levels, on/off toggle, adjustable budget, or fixed thinking) flows through chat and all generation paths and is mapped to the right provider-specific request fields (Anthropic `thinking`, OpenAI `reasoning`, etc.). The model selector becomes a unified provider/model/thinking popover with compact search and a much smaller toolbar footprint [#494](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/494)
- **End-of-course completion page with persistent quiz state** — When the outline is fully materialized, students see a course-complete view with quiz score card, scene-type stat cards, and a (motion-respecting) confetti celebration. Quiz answers persist on submit and grading results persist on completion, so navigating away and back restores the reviewing state with AI feedback intact instead of resetting [#484](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/484)
- Add latest released models including [GPT-5.5](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/487), DeepSeek-V4 (`-pro`, `-flash`), Xiaomi [MiMo](https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo) (`mimo-v2.5-pro`, `mimo-v2.5`), Tencent [Hy3](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan), and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) as a multi-provider gateway [#481](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/481) [#487](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/487)
- Add OpenAI image generation (GPT-Image-2) as a media provider [#481](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/481)
- Refresh built-in model registries across Anthropic, DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen, MiniMax, Grok, OpenAI, GLM, SiliconFlow, and Ollama; persisted local settings now rehydrate in registry order so newly curated lists appear consistent without clearing state [#481](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/481)
- Add inline search for recent classrooms on the home page with deferred filtering by name and description, keyboard-driven open/clear/collapse [#476](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/476)
- Add Deep-Interactive badge on classroom thumbnails for sessions generated with Interactive Mode [#478](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/478)
- Replace always-included media instruction blocks in generation prompts with conditional snippet includes gated on `imageEnabled` / `videoEnabled` — disabled capabilities are removed from the prompt entirely instead of relying on negative-override directives the model often ignored [#490](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/490) (by @YizukiAme)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix language drift between outline and scene generation by unifying the languageDirective across the pipeline so the same target language flows from outline planning through every per-scene call [#474](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/474)

### Other Changes

- Refactor whiteboard role prompts to file-based markdown templates and add a geometry-conflict detector (overlap, line-through-bbox, canvas clipping) that surfaces problems back to the model. Eval (flash, repeat 3, gemini-3.1-pro scorer) shows overall quality 5.4 → 6.1 and overlap 6.3 → 8.1 from prompt + detector alone [#485](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/485)
- Migrate orchestration prompt builders (`buildStructuredPrompt`, `buildDirectorPrompt`, `buildPBLSystemPrompt`) from inline TS template literals to file-based markdown templates under `lib/prompts/`, sharing the loader infrastructure with the generation pipeline. `prompt-builder.ts` 890 → 314 lines; future content tweaks land as markdown edits [#459](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/459)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Features

- **Deep Interactive Mode** — Generate hands-on interactive scenes (3D visualization, simulation, game, mind map/diagram, online programming) with an AI teacher who operates the UI to guide students.

- Add i18n key alignment check to CI so missing or extra translation keys fail the build [#447](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/447) (by @KanameMadoka520)
- Add whiteboard layout quality eval harness and unify it with the outline-language harness [#425](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/425) [#453](https://github.com/THU-MAIC/OpenMAIC/pull/453)
