/**
 * Module-level slide-edit session — pure in-memory undo/redo for the editor
 * canvas.
 *
 * EditShell invokes a surface's `useSurfaceState()` and renders its
 * `SurfaceComponent` as siblings (state hook on the shell, canvas as a child
 * of the frame). They must share one `SlideEditHistory`, so it lives in a
 * store rather than component state — the same idiom the rest of the
 * renderer uses (useCanvasStore / useStageStore).
 *
 * Edits are written through to the canonical stage store by the canvas
 * controller (`useSlideCanvasController` in `use-slide-surface.ts`); this
 * store only tracks the undo/redo timeline of an in-progress editing
 * session. It deliberately does NOT persist to localStorage: the canonical
 * stage store is the source of truth and already auto-persists via Dexie,
 * so there is nothing "unsaved" to recover on reload — no "restore unsaved
 * changes" UX, by design.
